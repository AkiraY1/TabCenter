## The Problem

As an experienced debater and tournament organizer, a serious issue I noticed in the Canadian debate circuit is the difficulty with which students have discovering new tournaments (often they are restricted to learning about tournaments by word of mouth and suggestions from their coach) and tournament organizers promoting their tournaments (often being restricted to emailing schools individually and using their personal connections). While the official provincial debate organizations list tournaments (like the DSABC in BC), they nearly always only list large, popular university-run tournaments and regionals/provincials. The end result is that students joining debate for the first time, students starting new debate clubs, and new high school-run tournaments, who lack connections and knowledge about Canadian debate, are at a very serious disadvantage and often quit. This cycle of exclusion is a key force behind the lack of high school-run debate tournaments and debate clubs across Canada.

## The Solution

I propose the implementation of a centralized platform to list every tournament in the country, making it extremely simple to find tournaments, register for tournaments, and advertise tournaments. Anyone would be able to add their own tournament to the website. It would essentially standardize registration, advertisement and payment for tournaments nationwide. The current state of exclusion would be replaced with a system where, with the click of a button, anyone anywhere could set up, learn about, and register for debate tournaments. I, with a friend, created a prototype named TabCenter.
